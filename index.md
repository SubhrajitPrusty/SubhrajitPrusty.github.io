## About Me

Hi! Curerntly, I am a Solutions Engineer @ [Skit](skit.ai). 
I am a Tech Enthusiast, who loves Linux. I'm an avid open-source supporter.
You can talk to me about games, tech and music.

I've been passionate about DevOps for a long time. I worked extensively with Docker on a Gitlab environment to facilitate CI/CD on my internship at racetrack.ai.
I also worked on a Python backend (falcon) based business solution platform and helped maintain the backend code of Marvin - a conversational AI.

I've also worked on projects regarding Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning in my aforementioned internship.
