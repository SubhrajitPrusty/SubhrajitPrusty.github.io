## About Me

Hi! Currently, I am a Solutions Engineer @ [Skit](https://skit.ai) (We're [hiring](https://skit.hire.trakstar.com/)), helping deliver AI powered Voicebots to the clients.
I am a Tech Enthusiast, who loves Linux. I'm an avid open-source supporter.
You can talk to me about games, tech and pop culture.

I worked extensively with Docker on a Gitlab environment to facilitate smoother workflows during my internship at racetrack.ai.
I also worked on a Python backend (falcon) based business solution platform and helped maintain the backend code of Marvin - a chat-bot powered by AI.
I've also worked on projects regarding NLP and DL/ML in previous internships.
