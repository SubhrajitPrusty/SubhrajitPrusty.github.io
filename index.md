## About Me

Hi! I am a Software Engineer @ [Skit](https://skit.ai), helping deliver AI-powered Voicebots.
I am a Tech Enthusiast, who loves Linux. I'm an avid open-source supporter.
You can talk to me about games, tech, and pop culture.

I worked extensively with Docker on a Gitlab environment to facilitate smoother workflows during my internship at racetrack.ai.
I also worked on a Python backend (falcon) based business solution platform and helped maintain the backend code of Marvin - a chatbot powered by AI.
I've also worked on projects regarding NLP and DL/ML in previous internships.
