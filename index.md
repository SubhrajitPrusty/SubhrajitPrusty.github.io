## About Me

Hello! I'm a Software Engineer at [Skit.ai](https://skit.ai), where I build **LLM-powered Voicebots**. My current focus is on creating real-time telephony systems with **gRPC**, integrating **Speech-to-Text** and **Text-to-Speech** services, and ensuring reliable, high-performance experiences for users.

I'm a Linux enthusiast and an avid open-source supporter. My work primarily revolves around Golang, real-time systems, and LLM-driven voice AI. I've built scalable backend services, optimized performance for production systems, and integrated AI into voicebots handling hundreds of thousands of calls. In previous roles, I worked with Python-based backends and AI-driven chatbots. I'm always excited to explore new technologies and share my learnings with the community.

Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, optimizing my home server setup, and experimenting with new tech stacks
